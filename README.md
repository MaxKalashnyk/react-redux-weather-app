# Weather application built with React and Redux

## [DEMO](https://kalash14.github.io/react-redux-weather-app/)

It's my the first application where I used **Redux** for state management.
Also I've implemented theme color switcher here with storing selected theme color in localStorage.

Technologies:

-   React.js
-   Redux
-   SCSS
-   localStorage
